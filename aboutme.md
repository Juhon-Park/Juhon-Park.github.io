My name is Juhong Park. 
I am currently pursuing a combined M.S/Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and computer engineering at SungKyunKwan University. 
My research interest lies primarily in

- processing-in-memory(PIM) based efficient DNN accelerators
- various on-device machine learning techniques

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
